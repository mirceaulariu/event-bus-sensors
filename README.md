# Event Bus Sensors
Developed an Event-Driven system using the GreenRobot eventbus displaying different instances of the virtual sensors' generated data.
# Features
It can display the maximum value out of all the measured data generated by the virtual sensors, it can also display a text based on the numeric data - if the weather is cold or warm, if the water or humidity level is high or low.
# Technologies
In this project I used Java language and the eventbus from GreenRobot(https://greenrobot.org/eventbus/).
# Usage
You should have Maven installed and you can run the project by compiling and running the Main.java file in /src/main/java/org/example/ .
